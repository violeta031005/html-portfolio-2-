    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nice to meet you! 
        <br/> My name is Violeta and I am new to web development. </p>
    <h2>My education</h2>
    <p>I am a high school student, who wants to learn more about web development.</p>
    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <p>I have not had a wide range of work places yet, but I have worked as a promoter in grocery store, called LIDL (2023 06.02 â€“ 10.02).</p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>I have learned about programming at school, so I can programme basic codes and exercises. Moreover, I am really good at math, which helps me to develop my logic. I know a little information about design, because I went to school, which provided teenagers with different kinds of classes.</p>
